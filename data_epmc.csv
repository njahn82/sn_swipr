However, its accuracy has not been prospectively validated in children. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of DE in predicting simultaneously measured right ventricular (RV) pressure by RHC in pediatric patients and to determine if the degree of RV hypertension affects the accuracy of DE in assessing right heart pressure.Eighty children (age range, 0-17.9 years; median age, 5.5 years) with two-ventricle physiology and a wide range of right heart pressures underwent simultaneous DE and RHC. The pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the right atrium was directly measured by RHC and simultaneously estimated by DE using tricuspid regurgitation. Patients were then grouped on the basis of RHC-measured RV systolic pressure (RVSP): group 1 (n = 43), with RVSP < 1/2 systemic systolic blood pressure (SBP); group 2 (n = 37), with RVSP ≥ 1/2 SBP; group 3 (n = 56), with RVSP < 2/3 SBP; and group 4 (n = 24), with RVSP ≥ 2/3 SBP. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were performed on all groups. Accuracy was predefined as 95% limits of agreement within ±10 mm Hg.Despite a reasonable correlation between DE and RHC in all groups, there was poor agreement between techniques as RVSP/SBP increased. DE was inaccurate in one of 43 patients in group 1 (2%) versus nine of 37 in group 2 (24%) and was inaccurate in one of 56 patients in group 3 (2%) versus eight of 24 in group 4 (33%). Overestimation and underestimation occurred equally in all groups.DE inaccurately estimates RV pressure in children with elevated right heart pressure. It should not be relied on as the sole method of assessing right heart hemodynamics in children with RV hypertension.",N,NIHMS537259,NA,NA

Thus, unraveling of mechanosensitive molecular mechanisms that determine cell fate in the setting of cardiac tissue injury is of scientific and clinical relevance. We tested the hypothesis that the prosurvival, mechanosensitive, serum glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK-1) is a pivotal determinant of pressure-related inflammatory response and cell fate in the ischemic-reperfused heart. METHODS: Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were subjected to an ischemia reperfusion (IR) insult, at 80 or 160cm water, with perfusate lacking or containing the SGK-1 inhibitor GSK650394A (1 μM); normoxic hearts served as controls. Thereafter, hearts tissues were used for Western blotting or cardiac cells were prepared for flow cytometry and immunofluorescent studies. RESULTS: An IR insult (i) reduced phosphoSGK-1 (active and protective) in association with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (ψm) and increased apoptosis and necrosis and (ii) increased expressions of growth-arrest and DNA damage-associated protein 153 (GADD153; a determinant of inflammation and cell death) and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 17; these effects were greater at high pressure. On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-27 increased more in ischemic-reperfused hearts subjected to low pressure. SGK-1 inhibition further reduced phosphoSGK-1, increased GADD153 and IL-17, and reduced IL-10 and IL-27 in association with augmented disruption of ψm and exacerbated cell death; these effects were greater at low pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a major pressure-related role for SGK-1 in regulating inflammation and cell fate in the ischemic-reperfused heart.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The present study is a randomized double-blinded trial in which we evaluated whether IV lidocaine infusion reduces isoflurane requirement, intraoperative remifentanil consumption and time to post-operative recovery in non-laparoscopic renal surgery. Sixty patients scheduled to undergo elective non-laparoscopic renal surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled to receive either systemic lidocaine infusion (group L: bolus 1.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at the rate of 2 mg/kg/hr until skin closure) or normal saline (0.9% NaCl solution) (Group C). The depth of anesthesia was monitored using the Bispectral Index Scale (BIS), which is based on measurement of the patient's cerebral electrical activity. Primary outcome of the study was End-tidal of isoflurane concentration (Et-Iso) at BIS values of 40-60. Secondary outcomes include remifentanil consumption during the operation and time to extubation. Et-Iso was significantly lower in group L than in group C (0.63% ± 0.10% vs 0.92% ± 0.11%, p < 10-3). Mean remifentanil consumption of was significantly lower in group L than in group C (0.13 ± 0.04 µg/kg/min vs 0.18 ± 0.04 µg/kg/min, p < 10-3). Thus, IV lidocaine infusion permits a reduction of 31% in isoflurane concentration requirement and 27% in the intraoperative remifentanil need. In addition, recovery from anesthesia and extubation time was shorter in group L (5.8 ± 1.8 min vs 7.9 ± 2.0 min, p < 10-3). By reducing significantly isoflurane and remifentanil requirements during renal surgery, intravenous lidocaine could provide effective strategy to limit volatile agent and intraoperative opioids consumption especially in low and middle income countries.",N,NA,cc by-nc,NA

Prevention also includes early detection activities, such as screening at-risk populations, as well as strategies for appropriate management of existing diseases and related complications. Early intervention, reducing morbidity and mortality rates could be an appealing idea for patients, physicians and governmental institutions but could also cause harm.

Patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were predominantly male, younger and had a lower burden of baseline comorbidities than HFpEF patients. Length of stay was longer for HFrEF (median 4 days) than HFpEF (median 3 days, p = 0.01). Mean total hospitalization cost was $9521. Mean costs trended higher for HFrEF patients than for HFpEF patients ($10,286 versus $8858, p = 0.07). Room and board contributed more than half of all costs.In this single-center study, we observed a trend towards higher HF hospitalization costs for patients with HFrEF, compared to HFpEF, even though patients with HFpEF are older and had more comorbid conditions. Costs were largely driven by length of stay, with higher heart rate at admission, lower systolic blood pressure, and higher creatinine associated with higher inpatient costs.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The indices of contractility (single-beat determined end-systolic elastance, Eesab) and afterload (effective arterial elastance, Ea) were approximated on the basis of the systemic blood pressure and systemic ventricular volume. The ratio of stroke work and pressure-volume area (SW/PVA) representing ventricular efficiency was also calculated.Age at the delivery was 28 (24-31) years. ZAHARA score was 0.75 (0.75-1.50).

Guided practices represent a new way of learning for undergraduate students of physiology, whereby the students turn into teacher-students and become more deeply involved in the subject by preparing and teaching a practical (laboratory) class to their peers. The goal was to assess the students' opinions about guided practices and how physiological parameters change during the activity. For this objective, two experiments were performed. First, a voluntary questionnaire on guided practices was completed by the students during 2 academic years. Students could also write a free text commentary. The positive answers obtained in the questionnaire and the free commentary responses point to the effectiveness of this methodology in students' minds. Negative aspects included the time spent preparing the activity, and the stress that students experienced in the teaching role. Second, information about how the teacher-students felt before teaching the practical class was self-reported, and physiological parameters related to stress (heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and electrocardiogram recorded to evaluate R-R interval and heart rate variability) were measured immediately before and while the practical class was taught. This evaluation reported an increase in stress during the execution of the practice. In conclusion, despite a new and stressful situation, guided practices are of interest for the students as a learning tool and for the acquisition of skills that may be of use in their later professional lives.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Across 1835 paired PCWP-CO measurements throughout exercise, we used regression techniques to define normative bounds of ""PCWP/CO slope"" in controls and tested the association of PCWP/CO slope with exercise capacity and composite cardiac outcomes (defined as cardiac death, incident resting PCWP elevation, or heart failure hospitalization) in the DOE-nlrW group. Relative to controls (PCWP/CO slope, 1.2±0.4 mm Hg/L/min), patients with HFpEF had a PCWP/CO slope of 3.4±1.9 mm Hg/L/min. We used a threshold (2 SD above the mean in controls) of 2 mm Hg/L/min to define abnormal.

Based on previous studies that demonstrated a possible role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of PAH, we investigated the effects of chronic inhibition of mitochondrial function in vivo in healthy rodents.Right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) was measured in female rats at baseline and up to 24 days after inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory Complex III, induced by Antimycin A (AA, 0.35 mg/kg, given three times starting at baseline and then days 3 and 6 as a bolus injection into the right atrial chamber).Rodents exposed to AA demonstrated sustained increases in RVSP from days 6 through 24. AA-exposed rodents also possessed a progressive increase in RV end-diastolic pressure but not RV hypertrophy, which may be attributed to either early stages of PAH development or to reduced RV contractility due to inhibition of myocardial respiration. Protein nitration levels in plasma were positively correlated with PAH development in AA-treated rats. This finding was strongly supported by results obtained from PAH humans where plasma protein nitration levels were correlated with markers of PAH severity in female but not male PAH patients. Based on previously reported associations between increased nitric oxide production levels with female gender, we speculate that in females with PAH mitochondrial dysfunction may represent a more deleterious form, in part, due to an increased nitrosative stress development. Indeed, the histological analysis of AA treated rats revealed a strong perivascular edema, a marker of pulmonary endothelial damage. Finally, AA treatment was accompanied by a severe metabolic shift toward glycolysis, a hallmark of PAH pathology.Chronic mitochondrial dysfunction induces the combination of vascular damage and metabolic reprogramming that may be responsible for PAH development. This mechanism may be especially important in females, perhaps due to an increased NO production and nitrosative stress development.",NA,NA,NA,NA

These diseases represent two distinct forms of left ventricular systolic overload and in combination may be associated with disadvantageous left ventricular remodeling, increased mortality and heart failure. The treatment of hypertension in aortic stenosis remains a challenging problem with limited data to guide clinical practice.We performed a comprehensive online literature review to find relevant published literature on the topic of hypertension and aortic stenosis.In the present manuscript, we review the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis in combination with hypertension and the effects on the left ventricle. We also provide general recommendations for medical therapy for treatment of hypertension in aortic stenosis and review the available data on specific antihypertensive agents in this context.Aortic stenosis and hypertension commonly coexist and significantly impact the diagnosis and classification of aortic stenosis severity and symptoms. Treatment of hypertension among patients with severe aortic stenosis can be challenging. Among specific antihypertensive agents studied in this context, ACE-inhibitors are the most well studied.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, we aimed to determine their predictive properties for postoperative AKI severity within 30 days after HTx.From 1984 to 2016, all consecutive HTx recipients (n = 595) in our tertiary referral center were included and analyzed for the occurrence of postoperative AKI staged by the kidney disease improving global outcome criteria. The effects of preoperative RHH parameters on postoperative AKI were calculated using logistic regression, and predictive accuracy was assessed using integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC).Postoperative AKI occurred in 430 (72%) patients including 278 (47%) stage 1, 66 (11%) stage 2, and 86 (14%) stage 3 cases. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was administered in 41 (7%) patients. Patients with higher AKI stages had also higher baseline right atrial pressure (RAP; median 7, 7, 8, and in RRT 11 mmHg, p trend = 0.021), RAP-to-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ratio (median 0.37, 0.36, 0.40, 0.47, p trend = 0.009), and lower pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) values (median 2.83, 3.17, 2.54, 2.31, p trend = 0.012).

This study evaluates the efficacy of landiolol hydrochloride for managing junctional ectopic tachycardia.A single-center retrospective study.PICU at the university hospital.Of 561 pediatric patients who underwent open-heart surgery between 2006 and 2017, 10 patients developed sustained junctional ectopic tachycardia and were selected for landiolol treatment.None.Landiolol decreased mean heart rate significantly from 206.1 ± 14.5 to 158.0 ± 8.6 beats/min within 2 hours after administration (p < 0.01). Mean time to achieve 20% heart rate reduction was 2.1 ± 0.5 hours. Systolic blood pressure between pre and post landiolol administration did not change significantly (72.6 ± 5.9 to 79.7 ± 6.2 mm Hg). Once junctional heart rate was sufficiently suppressed, atrioventricular sequential pacing was introduced to stabilize hemodynamics. Nine of 10 cases (90%) had atrioventricular sequential pacing to maintain appropriate heart rate and restore atrioventricular synchronicity under suppressed junctional heart rate. Subsequently, eight of 10 cases (80%) were converted to regular sinus rhythm within 24 hours after starting landiolol administration. The average time to achieve sinus rhythm conversion was 7.9 ± 3.4 hours.Landiolol rapidly suppresses junctional heart rate in junctional ectopic tachycardia after pediatric heart surgery without significant blood pressure compromises. Subsequent atrioventricular sequential pacing was effective at restoring atrioventricular synchronicity and stabilizing hemodynamics. Combining junctional rate control with landiolol and atrioventricular sequential pacing is therefore suggested as a promising option for prompt management of postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Even though several studies have demonstrated negative health effects, snus is often depicted as harmless. The aim of the present study was to investigate acute vascular effects of snus as measured by arterial stiffness as well as blood pressure and heart rate.Two separate randomized double-blind crossover studies with the same study design were pooled for analysis. Twenty-nine healthy snus-users (17 females, 12 males) were included. Snus (Göteborgs Rapé) and tobacco free snus (Onico) were administered in a randomized order at two separate visits. Arterial stiffness, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at baseline as well as every five minutes for 40 minutes during exposure. Following snus removal, measurements continued for 30 minutes post exposure. Arterial stiffness was measured using pulse wave velocity (Vicorder) and pulse wave analysis (Sphygmocor).Compared to placebo, snus significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate, however, only in females (p = 0.004, p = 0.006 and p<0.001 respectively). No changes were seen in arterial stiffness measurements in either gender.We observed an increase in blood pressure and heart rate only in females, but not in males due to snus usage as compared to placebo. This novel finding was surprising and needs to be further investigated considering most of the earlier studies have mainly focused on male snus users and the increasing usage of snus among females.",NA,NA,NA,NA

We obtain three months of PPG-based heart rate data from subjects with and without hypertension, and calculate the HRV based on various forms of time and frequency domain analysis. We then apply a data mining technique to this estimated HRV data, to see if it is possible to correctly identify patients with hypertension.

However, it remained to be investigated whether BDNF is involved in the mediation of stress-induced cardiovascular responses. Here, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of the high-affinity BDNF receptor TrkB in the PVN diminishes acute stress-induced cardiovascular responses. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were equipped with radiotelemetric transmitters for blood pressure measurement. BDNF-TrkB signaling was selectively inhibited by viral vector-mediated bilateral PVN overexpression of a dominant-negative truncated TrkB receptor (TrkB.T1, n=7), while control animals (n=7) received green fluorescence protein (GFP) expressing vector injections. Rats were subjected to acute water and restraint stress 3-4 weeks after vector injections. We found that body weight, food intake, baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate were unaffected by TrkB.T1 overexpression. However, peak MAP increases were significantly reduced in the TrkB.T1 group compared with GFP both during water stress (GFP: 39{plus minus}2 mmHg; TrkB.T1: 27{plus minus}4 mmHg; p<0.05) and restraint stress (GFP: 41{plus minus}3 mmHg; TrkB.T1: 34{plus minus}2 mmHg; p<0.05). Average MAP elevations during the post-stress period were also significantly reduced following both water and restraint stress in the TrkB.T1 group compared with GFP. In contrast, heart rate elevations to both stressors remained unaffected by TrkB.T1 overexpression. Our results demonstrate that activation of BDNF high-affinity TrkB receptors within the PVN is a major contributor to acute stress-induced blood pressure elevations.",NA,NA,NA,NA

We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials.

No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension.

Since the pattern of right ventricular (RV) pressure decrease is quite different from that of the left ventricular, we hypothesized that novel kinematic model parameters are more appropriate and useful to evaluate RV diastolic dysfunction.Eight patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (age 12.5±4.8 years) and 20 normal subjects (control group; age 12.3±4.4 years) were enrolled. The kinematic model was parametrized by stiffness/restoring Ek and damping/relaxation μ. The model predicts isovolumic relaxation pressure as a function of time as the solution of d2P/dt2+(1/μ)dP/dt+EkP=0, based on the theory that the pressure decay is determined by the interplay of inertial, stiffness/restoring, and damping/relaxation forces.

The intent is to provide the background and the supporting evidence for the recommendations and to provide practical guidance for management strategies in treatment of heart failure patients.In the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of HF guidelines, important additions include new information on biomarkers, specifically on the topics of the diagnostic, prognostic role of natriuretic peptides in heart failure, and the role of natriuretic peptides in screening in patients high risk for HF and prevention of HF. There are important recommendations for treatment of patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), including the beneficial role of angiotensin receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibition (ARNI) treatment in reducing outcomes including mortality, ivabradine in reducing heart failure hospitalizations in stable HFrEF patients with sinus rhythm and heart rate ≥ 70 bpm despite β-blockers. In patients with HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), though there are no studies demonstrating survival benefit, potential benefit with aldosterone antagonism in reducing HF hospitalizations is noted. In treatment of comorbidities, optimization of blood pressure control to less than 130 mmHg is recommended in hypertensive patients to prevent HF or in patients with hypertension and HFrEF or HFpEF. In addition to recognition on the potential role of treatment of iron deficiency anemia to improve symptoms and functional capacity, caution against use of adaptive servo-ventilation in patients with HFrEF and central sleep apnea and against use of erythropoietin stimulating agents in patients with HFrEF is provided. There are new treatment strategies that are associated with significant improvements in mortality and other outcomes in patients with HF. Successful management of HF requires recognition of indications, contraindications, benefits, safety, and risk of these new therapies. In addition to incorporation of these new treatment strategies, it is critical to focus also on patient education, care coordination, identification of goals of care, monitoring, management of comorbidities, and individualization of therapies. New treatment modalities increase the choices for treatment and provide the opportunity to implement individualized treatment strategies for our patients.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The human being may suffer harm from medical interventions from conception, during their childhood, during their entire healthy lifetime as well as during a self-limited disease, a chronic disease, or a terminal disease. The current definition of quaternary prevention has limitations because it excludes patients and medical interventions where a quaternary prevention perspective would be needed and useful to protect patients from harm.

In contrast, closing volume increased proportionately with heart rate, but PVL did not change. The minimal cross-sectional gap had a positive correlation with the PVL volumes (r=0.89, P=0.02).

Forty-four healthy volunteers were subjected to sympathetic stimulation by continuous lower body negative pressure (LBNP) until the onset of pre-syncopal symptoms. Changes in PP and HR were tracked non-invasively and modeled by linear mixed effect (LME) models. The dataset was split into two groups: the first was used for creating a model and the second for its evaluation. Models were created on the data obtained during LBNP. Model performance was expressed as absolute median error (1st; 3rd quantiles) and bias with limits of agreement (LOA) between modeled and measured PP. From rest to sympathetic stimulation, mean BP was maintained while HR increased (~30%) and PP decreased gradually (~20%). During baseline, PP could be modeled with an absolute error of 6 (4; 10) mm Hg and geometric mean ratio of the bias was 0.97 (LOA: 0.8-1.1). During LBNP, absolute median model error was 5 (4; 8) mmHg with geometric mean ratio 1.02 (LOA: 0.8-1.3).

The data collected by the wearable devices included the number of steps taken, sleep duration, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, fatigue, and mood of the wearers. Using a questionnaire and the trajectory equifinality model, we interviewed and surveyed elderly adults in order to understand their health status and social capital.The health of the participants was generally good, and most were able to achieve > 8000 steps per day (p < 0.05). Mild and moderate fatigue symptoms were noted in elderly adults for 90% of the study period (p < 0.05). The number of steps, blood pressure, and heart rate changed significantly within a month. From the commencement of using the wearable devices, a steady increase was noted in the monthly number of steps. Interviews suggested that the elderly adults perceived wearable devices as having the potential to improve health and social capital.By using wearable devices, the participants had a better understanding of their own health, and were willing to take health-boosting measures.

The data from 24-h Holter monitoring and blood pressure recorded by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were collected. Measured data were divided into three categories: 24-h, daytime and night-time. From power spectral density in the electrocardiogram, low frequency, high frequency and low frequency/high frequency ratio were calculated. The primary end-point was death.High blood pressure was connected to both high daytime low frequency and high frequency (partial correlation coefficients: 0.42, P < 0.05 and 0.35, P < 0.05, respectively). In addition, the low blood pressure group had higher mortality than the high blood pressure group, and disabled older adults in long-term care and those with elevated daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure had less risk of mortality compared with those without (systolic: hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.83-0.96, P = 0.003; diastolic: hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.79-1.00, P = 0.049).

The first report of HUT as a clinical tool to confirm a diagnosis of suspected VVS was published in 1966, and led to the concept of using HUT as a diagnostic tool for VVS. Subsequently, HUT testing, either drug-free or, if necessary, with pharmacological provocation (usually nitroglycerin) has proven to be a useful and safe modality for identifying susceptibility to VVS. In this regard, it is recognized that VVS is best diagnosed by careful history taking. Unfortunately, the history may be non-diagnostic; HUT may be helpful in such cases. However, the interpretation of HUT requires care and experience; in particular, the outcome must be consistent with the patient's clinical presentation.

However, microRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of PDE5A has not been reported. The aim of this study is to screen the microRNAs that are able to regulate PDE5A and explore the function of the microRNAs in cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling.Although miR-19a/b-3p (microRNA-19a-3p and microRNA-19b-3p) have been reported to be differentially expressed during cardiac hypertrophy, the direct targets and the functions of this microRNA family for regulation of cardiac hypertrophy have not yet been investigated. The present study identified some direct targets and the underlying functions of miR-19a/b-3p by using bioinformatics tools and gene manipulations within mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes. Transfection of miR-19a/b-3p down-regulated endogenous expressions of PDE5A at both mRNA and protein levels with real-time PCR and western blot. Luciferase reporter assays showed that PDE5A was a direct target of miR-19a/b-3p. In mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy, we found that miR-19a/b-3p was expressed in cardiomyocytes and that its expression was reduced in pressure overload-induced hypertrophic hearts. miR-19a/b-3p transgenic mice prevented the progress of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling in response to angiotensin II infusion with echocardiographic assessment and pressure-volume relation analysis.Our study elucidates that PDE5A is a novel direct target of miR-19a/b-3p, and demonstrates that antihypertrophic roles of the miR-19a/b-3p family in Ang II-induced hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling, suggests that endogenous miR-19a/b-3p might have clinical potential to suppress cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Traditional hypoglycemic drugs have demonstrated their capability for effective and maintained management of high glucose levels, but they have not significantly impacted on the incidence of CV events. Recently, a new class of hypoglycemic agents, SGLT-2 receptor inhibitors, has been developed. The EMPA-OUTCOME trial involving empagliflozin (a SGLT-2 receptor inhibitor) has shown significant reductions in major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure (HF) when administered on top of standard-of-care therapy for T2DM patients at high CV risk. The dramatic change driving the superiority of the primary composite outcome (major adverse CV events) was a significantly lower CV death rate (38% relative risk reduction). In addition, there were also an impressive 35 and 32% relative risk reductions in hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and death from any cause, respectively. These effects are even more important given the difficulties for treating concomitant HF in T2DM patients. These surprising results have been also corroborated by another agent of this class, canagliflozin, and the CANVAS trial. The magnitude of these somehow surprising cardiac benefits attained in the absence of major differences in glycemic, lipid, or blood pressure (BP) control has led to several groups to suggest that these benefits may be independent of its hypoglycemic activity and whether this new class could be considered a ""cardiac"" drug. The objective of this review has been to review the different hypotheses proposed to explain the cardiac benefits of this new class of antidiabetic drugs.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Liver stiffness (LS) assessed non-invasively using transient elastography is related to increased RAP and liver congestion in patients with general HF. We investigated the relationship of LS with clinical and echocardiographic variables and outcomes in patients with ADHF.Methods and Results:The subjects were 105 patients with ADHF admitted to hospital between October 2016 and June 2017. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on median LS at admission (low LS <8.8 kPa [n=52] vs. high LS ≥8.8 kPa [n=53]). Death from cardiovascular disease and readmission for HF were primary endpoints. Total bilirubin and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, MELD-XI score, diameters of the inferior vena cava and right ventricle, and severity of tricuspid regurgitation were greater in the high LS group (all P<0.05). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 153 (83-231) days, cardiac events occurred in 29 patients (54%) in the high LS group and in 13 (25%) in the low LS group (P=0.001). After adjusting for variables that influence organ congestion, a high LS ≥8.8 kPa was still significantly associated with cardiac events (all P<0.05).Increased LS measured by transient elastography reflects RAP elevation, hepatic congestion, and hepatic dysfunction.

Its physiologic basis and clinical significance remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of SctO2 with oxygen transport physiology and known prognostic factors during both rest and exercise in patients with HFrEF or stroke. Thirty-four HFrEF patients, 26 stroke patients, and 17 healthy controls performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. Integrated near-infrared spectroscopy and automatic gas analysis were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation and cardiac and ventilatory parameters. We found that SctO2 (rest; peak) were significantly lower in the HFrEF (66.3±13.3%; 63.4±13.8%,) than in the stroke (72.1±4.2%; 72.7±4.5%) and control (73.1±2.8%; 72±3.2%) groups. In the HFrEF group, SctO2 at rest (SctO2rest) and peak SctO2 (SctO2peak) were linearly correlated with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), peak oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]), and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (r between -0.561 and 0.677, p < 0.001). Stepwise linear regression showed that SctO2rest was determined by partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide at rest (PETCO2rest), hemoglobin, and mean arterial pressure at rest (MAPrest) (adjusted R = 0.681, p < 0.05), while SctO2peak was mainly affected by peak carbon dioxide production ([Formula: see text]) (adjusted R = 0.653, p < 0.05) in patients with HFrEF. In conclusion, the study delineates the relationship of cerebral saturation and parameters associated with oxygen delivery. Moreover, SctO2peak and SctO2rest are correlated with some well-recognized prognostic factors in HFrEF, suggesting its potential prognostic value.",NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature. Statistical analysis was performed using the student t-test, Fisher's exact test, and ANOVA for Cross-over design. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Twenty-nine patients were analyzed. Although phenylephrine infusion significantly increased mean arterial pressure (P < 0.001), arterial partial pressure of oxygen did not differ between the two timepoints (P = 0.19).

In an attempt to improve adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, interventions are often used. Interventions may involve a pharmacist, but it is not always clear whether these are effective.The primary objective of this review is to determine whether interventions by pharmacists, alone, discussing adherence to medicines, improve adherence to medicines for cardiovascular disease. Subsequently, the review links the characteristics of the individual studies with effectiveness or lack of effect. The second objective of this review is to consider whether any improvement in adherence with interventions by pharmacist is associated with better clinical outcomes.A literature search of PubMed and CINAHL for 'pharmacist', 'medicine' with 'adherence' or 'compliance' or 'persistence' was undertaken. To be included in this review, papers had to be of a pharmacist working alone and in person in an intervention of subjects with hypertension, hyperlipidemia (prior to or after a coronary artery event) or heart failure. The paper had to be published in a peer review journal, with a measure of adherence to medicines. The effectiveness of the intervention had to be evaluated after ≥6 months.Only 3 out of 8 interventions by pharmacists in hypertension, and 5 out of 12 interventions in subjects with hyperlipidemia led to improved adherence to medicines. In contrast, all 6 interventions by a pharmacist in subjects with heart failure were successful in improving adherence. One characteristic of successful interventions by pharmacists to improve adherence to cardiovascular medicines is that they must be more than brief/single interventions. A second characteristic is that the intervention should not involve subjects who are already highly adherent, as it is unlikely adherence can be improved in this population. Only 2 of 3 successful interventions in hypertension were associated with small reductions in blood pressure, and only one intervention in hyperlipidemia was shown to decrease LDL-cholesterol to a small extent. In subjects with heart failure, 5 of the 6 successful studies of the successful interventions by pharmacists to increase adherence also showed improved clinical outcomes.When planning an intervention to improve adherence to medicines and cardiovascular outcomes in subjects with hypertension or hyperlipidemic, by a pharmacist alone, or as part of a multi-faceted interventions, it is essential to use an intervention that has been shown to be effective, as most interventions are not effective at improving adherence or only improve adherence and clinical outcomes to a small extent. In heart failure, there is well documented evidence of interventions by pharmacists that do improve clinical outcomes, which should be adopted widely.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to the interaction and gender differences, the predicting value of these risk models for women could be controversial.Databases from the China Patient-centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events (China PEACE) Retrospective AMI Study were utilized for model derivation (n=16,100, women were 4896) and databases from the China PEACE Prospective AMI Study for model validation (n=6207, women were 2090). A multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression was used to examine correlates of in-hospital mortality, and the variables were subsequently weighted and integrated into a scoring system.We constructed a novel risk-predicting tool to estimate the baseline risk of in-hospital mortality among women with AMI. The risk score includes 8 variables [age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, initial glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum glucose, Killip class, cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF)]. The prognostic discriminatory capacity of the Women Acute Myocardial Infarction in-Hospital Mortality (WAMI) risk score was excellent (c statistic 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83 to 0.86, p<0.001).

Fast Fourier transformation revealed a spectral profile with two main components in CBFV, one in the very low frequency (VLF, 0.01-0.025 Hz), and the other in the low frequency band (LF, 0.075-0.11 Hz). During the task, CBFV variability decreased. While heart rate variability and respiration had only weak impacts, BP variability was closely associated with CBFV variability. LF CBFV variability correlated negatively with task performance.

In many cases, however, this preoperative diagnosis cannot be confirmed intraoperatively.We wanted to find out whether this is just an impression or whether there actually are significant differences between preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary artery pressures.After obtaining ethical approval, we retrospectively compared the pulmonary pressures of cardiac surgery patients with an elevated pulmonary pressure during preoperative right heart catheterization with those obtained intraoperatively and postoperatively by means of a PAC. All patients with a preoperatively documented pulmonary artery pressure of 40 mmHg or above and an intraoperative use of a PAC during a 4-year period were included. Exclusion criteria were intracardiac shunts, cardiogenic shock, emergency procedures, pulmonary hypertension of non-cardiac origin and a time span of more than 1 year between right heart catheterization and surgery. We included 90 patients.In the whole group and in the subgroups (according to diagnosis, time elapsed between heart catheterization and operation and pulmonary pressure), there were significant differences between preoperative and intraoperative pulmonary and systemic pressures. Systemic and pulmonary artery pressures were significantly higher during preoperative catheterization than intraoperatively. The systemic systolic pressure/systolic pulmonary pressure ratio, however, remained constant. The intraoperative and postoperative systemic and pulmonary artery pressures showed no significant differences. As a normal ejection fraction does not exclude heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and as we did not have any information on this condition, we did not group the patients according to the ejection fraction.An elevated pulmonary pressure obtained preoperatively during right heart catheterization is not indicative of an elevated pulmonary pressure either intraoperatively or postoperatively. There are various explanations for the differences (e.g., different physiological and pathophysiological settings, such as sedation with potential hypercapnia versus anesthesia with vasodilation when measured; newly prescribed medication coming into effect between the right heart catheterization and surgery; intraoperative positioning). Even though the inherent risks of a PAC seem to be low, we recommend refraining from using a PAC in patients with a once documented elevated pulmonary pressure by default. As an alternative we suggest estimating the pulmonary pressure by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as an aid to decide whether the patient will benefit from the use of a PAC. Especially if it is not possible to identify tricuspid valve regurgitation for determining the peak gradient, it is helpful to check for additional signs of pulmonary hypertension. But we also have to bear in mind that in the postoperative period only a PAC can provide continuous measurement of pulmonary pressure.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, this study aims to clarify the effects of H2RAs on myocardial function in CHF patients by meta-analysis.Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were retrieved. Randomized controlled trials comparing the cardiac effects of H2RAs and placebo or other medicines were collected. Pooled mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software.A total of 10 studies (472 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. H2RAs exhibited significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects to reduce heart rate (MD: -3.90; 95%CI: -7.07 to -0.73, P = .02). Furthermore, although H2RAs did not affect the blood pressure in health volunteers, they significantly decreased the blood pressure of CHF patients. Additionally, H2RAs were also associated with significant increase in pre-ejection period and the ratio of pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time.In summary, these findings showed that H2RAs exerted negative inotropic and chronotropic effects to reduce heart rate and blood pressure, which, similar to beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, might decrease myocardial oxygen demand and eventually result in improvement of CHF symptoms. These data provided further evidence for the effect of H2RAs on cardiac function and novel potential strategy for treatment of CHF.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) plays a regulatory role in cellular response to hypoxia. Protective effects of EPO on heart, kidney and nervous system are unrelated to red blood cell production. We investigated early changes in and effects of EPO on renal tissues of rats with myocardial infarction by morphology and immunohistochemistry. Coronary artery ligation was used to induce myocardial infarction in Wistar rats.

On sub-group analyses in the TAC group, improved cardiac function and alleviation of fibrosis was observed in the HSF1 TG subgroup as compared to that in the wild type subgroup. Expressions of LC3II/LC3I, Becline-1 and HIF-1, too showed an obvious increase; and increased autophagosome formation was observed on electron microscopy. Opposite results were observed in the HSF1 KO subgroup. These results collectively suggest that in the pressure overload heart failure model, HSF1 promoted formation of macrophages by inducing upregulation of HIF-1 expression, through which heart failure was ameliorated.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Concern on hypotension may be limiting use of sacubitril/valsartan in appropriate patients.We characterized patients in PARADIGM-HF by whether they reported hypotension during study run-in periods (enalapril, followed by sacubitril/valsartan) and after randomization and assessed whether hypotension modified the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan. Of the 10 513 patients entering the enalapril run-in, 136 (1.3%) experienced hypotension and 93 (68%) were unable to continue to the next phase; of 9419 patients entering the sacubitril/valsartan run-in period, 228 (2.4%) patients experienced hypotension and 51% were unable to successfully complete the run-in. After randomization, 388 (9.2%) participants had 501 hypotensive events with enalapril, and 588 (14.0%) participants had 803 hypotensive events with sacubitril/valsartan (P<0.001). There was no difference between randomized treatment groups in the number of participants who discontinued therapy because of hypotension. Individuals with a hypotensive event in either group were older, had lower blood pressure at randomization, and were more likely to have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Participants with hypotensive events during run-in who were ultimately randomized derived similar efficacy from sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril as those without hypotensive events (P interaction>0.90).Hypotension was more common with sacubitril/valsartan relative to enalapril in PARADIGM-HF but did not differentially affect permanent discontinuations.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that outcomes for diabetes are improved by intensive glycaemic control, blood pressure control, and treatment of dyslipidaemia plus smoking cessation. The aim of this study was to compare mortalities in type 1 diabetes with non-diabetes subjects, and to investigate the effects of age, gender, glycaemic control, socio-economic status, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), smoking status, body mass index (BMI) and dyslipidaemia.A population-based analysis in Ayrshire and Arran, Scotland. 253,304 non diabetes and 1324 type 1 diabetes subjects were tracked from 2009 to 2014.Type 1 diabetes patients had higher mortality rates than non-diabetes subjects (HR 3.20; p<0.01) with relative mortality for female type 1 diabetes subjects higher than in males (OR 2.38 vs. 1.52; p<0.01). Increasing age (HR 2.37), smoking (HR 1.85), IHD (HR 1.62) and hypertension (HR 1.21) (all p<0.01) increased mortality risk. A hypertensive female with type 1 diabetes who smoked with IHD had a HR of 11.6 compared with a non-smoking, normotensive non-diabetes female with no IHD. For a hypertensive male type 1 patient with IHD who smoked, the HR was 6.96. BMI > 30kg/m2 was associated with reduced mortality risk in both non-diabetes (HR 0.61) and diabetes subjects (HR 0.40).This study confirmed that the mortality risk in people with type 1 diabetes remains elevated.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), influence the subfornical organ (SFO) to modulate sympathetic activity and blood pressure. The pressor effects of TNFα in the SFO are partially mediated by angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type 1 (AT1R), and TNFα is known to potentiate Ang II-induced hypertension. However, the cellular mechanism of the interaction between TNFα and Ang II/AT1R signaling remains unknown. In the present study, we performed Ca2+ imaging on dissociated SFO neurons in vitro from male Sprague-Dawley rats to determine if TNFα modulates Ang II-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ in SFO neurons. We first established that a proportion of SFO neurons respond to Ang II, an effect that required AT1R signaling and extracellular Ca2+. We then tested the hypothesis that TNFα may modulate the effects of Ang II on SFO neurons by examining the effects of TNFα treatment on the Ang II-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+. We discovered that TNFα potentiated the Ang II-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+, an effect that was dependent on the duration of TNFα treatment. Lastly, we determined that this potentiation of Ang II-induced Ca2+ activity relied on TTX-sensitive voltage-gated Na+ channels. These data suggest that the potentiation of Ang II/AT1R activity by TNFα in SFO neurons results from the previously demonstrated ability of this cytokine to modulate the activation threshold of voltage-gated Na+ currents.",NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, in animal models opioid agonists reduce isolation distress whereas opioid antagonists increase isolation distress. We recently reported that the mixed mu agonist and kappa antagonist buprenorphine dampened responses to acute psychosocial stress in humans. Now we extend this to study the effects of a pure mu-opioid agonist, hydromorphone, and a non-opioid analgesic, acetaminophen, on response to social stress. We compared the effect of hydromorphone (2 and 4 mg), acetaminophen (1000 mg) to a placebo using a between subject design. Healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 13), 2 mg hydromorphone (N = 12), 4 mg hydromorphone (N = 12), or 1000 mg acetaminophen (paracetamol; N = 13) under double-blind conditions before undergoing a stress task or a control task on two separate sessions. The stress task, consisting of a standardized speaking task and the non-stressful control task were presented in counterbalanced order. Dependent measures included mood ratings, subjective appraisal of the stress (or no-stress) task, salivary cortisol, pupil diameter, heart rate, and blood pressure. The stress task produced its expected increase in heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, pupil diameter, and subjective ratings of anxiety and negative mood. Hydromorphone dose-dependently dampened cortisol responses to stress, and decreased ratings of how ""challenging"" participants found the task. Acetaminophen did not affect physiological responses, but, like hydromorphone, decreased ratings of how ""challenging"" the task was. The hydromorphone results support the idea that the mu-opioid system is involved in physiological responses to acute stress in humans, in line with results from preclinical studies. The non-opioid analgesic acetaminophen did not dampen physiological responses, but did reduce some components of psychological stress. It remains to be determined how both opioid and non-opioid systems mediate the complex physiological and psychological responses to social stress.",NA,NA,NA,NA

We elucidated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the autonomous nervous system in healthy youngsters. Thirty healthy subjects aged 18-25 years were recruited based on their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D): 15 vitamin D insufficient (25[OH]D < 50 nmol/L) and 15 vitamin D sufficient (25[OH]D > 80 nmol/L) subjects. Both groups had vitamin D supplementation (30 microg/day) and were tested at baseline and after 30, 90, and 180 days. At each visit the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured and the head-up tilt test performed. Serum 25[OH]D remained stable in the vitamin D sufficient group, while the insufficient group had a significant increase (32.0-64.5 nmol/L), P < 0.0001. Despite the increase, the insufficient group did not reach the level of the vitamin D sufficient group within the 6 months observational period (96.1 vs 64.5 nmol/L), P < 0.01. Serum norepinephrine at baseline was higher in the insufficient group (mean = 1.61 nmol/L) than in the vitamin D sufficient group (mean = 0.94 nmol/L), P < 0.01, whereas the response to tilt was lower in the insufficient group (mean = 0.69 nmol/L) compared to the sufficient group (mean = 1.17 nmol/L), P < 0.01.

The systolic and diastolic blood pressure differed between the groups after a month, with higher pressures in the insufficient group than in the sufficient group.

BP and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously and rate pressure product (systolic BP x HR) was calculated as an index of myocardial oxygen demand. Coronary blood velocity was obtained by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in 8/17 subjects. The mean BP response to plantar flexion exercise was attenuated by leg revascularization (pre revascularization: 15 {plus minus} 4 vs. post revascularization: 7 {plus minus} 3 mmHg, P = 0.025). The HR response to plantar flexion was also attenuated following leg revascularization (pre revascularization: 9 {plus minus} 1 vs. post revascularization: 6 {plus minus} 1 beats/min, P = 0.006).
